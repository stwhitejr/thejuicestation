        <p class="AdvisoryBoardFull-content">
          David O’Brien, founder of The Green Light, is a respected nutrition and health expert, well-known across the South Shore of Boston, MA. He has been featured in various health magazines and talk shows for his work that has changed thousands of people’s lives.
        </p>
        <p class="AdvisoryBoardFull-content">
          David’s passion for healthy eating began 10 years ago when he set out on a journey to find out not only what it takes for the human body to survive, but what it takes on a cellular level for the human body to thrive. Dedicating thousands of hours to researching the human body, David traveled the country volunteering at raw food kitchens to learn as much as possible – taking whatever measures necessary including sleeping in his car and taking showers at the local gyms.
        </p>
        <p class="AdvisoryBoardFull-content">
          Having initially set out with the goal to learn how to help other people, David made changes to his own diet along the way and quickly experienced drastic improvement in his personal health. Today David continues on his quest to help other people through his work at The Green Light and Dave’s Raw Food.

          Understanding and helping others achieve optimal health, both mind and body have always been a love of mine.  I have worked in the healthcare industry for over 30 years, working from pediatrics to geriatrics, all with different challenges.  Unfortunately, several year ago, like many others, I experienced some very untimely and personal losses and I couldn’t understand why so many people were getting sick and not being able to recover. The feeling of helplessness was overwhelming.  I began to read everything I could get my hands on in an attempt to understand what was happening. What I discovered, and am still discovering today, was how fascinating the human body is, how it is developed to be strong and self-healing and what we can do every day to help our bodies to heal and repair itself. Our bodies can heal itself as long as we provide it with the right environment.  My passion is educating the many ways in which we can support our bodies to act in the miraculous way it was intended.  Eating and juicing real whole foods and cleansing our bodies at the cellular level is just one of the many ways we can achieve this.
